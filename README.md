# SQL Business Challenge – DataCamp (2026)

## Description
In this project, SQL is used to analyze the data of a fictional online bookstore. The analysis aims to extract meaningful business insights related to inventory, sales, customer spending, and temporal trends, supporting data-driven decisions.

## Dataset
The analysis is based on three tables:
- **books**: book information (title, author, genre, price)
- **customers**: customer details (name, city, signup date)
- **orders**: purchase records (customer, book, quantity, order date)

## Business Questions
1. How many books are available in each genre?
2. What was the total revenue in January 2024?
3. Who are the top 5 customers by total spending?
4. Which genres sell the most, and how do sales trends evolve over time?

## Tools & Skills
- SQL (JOINs, GROUP BY, aggregation, date filtering)
- Business-oriented data analysis
- Trend and revenue analysis

## Key Takeaways
- Mystery and Technology are the strongest-performing genres.
- A small group of customers accounts for a large share of total revenue.
